==========

  As the name stands for, the focus here is a simple application capable of managing posts and replys with a single page aproach.

  Moreover, it is a proof of concepts. Basicaly a domain driven design java application, persisting with mongoDB and Jongo (jongo.org). Also defining a RESTfull service with the JBOSS RESTEasy and just for the fun of it, experimenting with JEE6 CDI and Google Angular. 
  
  To run it you will need a instance of mongoDB running localy on your machine, then simply clean install on maven. Deploy on your JEE 6 web container, since it requires CDI anabled web server.
