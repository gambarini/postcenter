		As the name stands for, the focus here is a simple application capable of managing 
	posts and reply with a single page approach.

		Moreover, it is a proof of concepts. Basically a domain driven design application,   
	persisting with mongoDB and Jongo (jongo.org). Also defining a RESTfull service with 
	the JBOSS RESTEasy and just for the fun of it, experimenting with JEE6 CDI and Google Angular.

		To run it you will need an instance of mongoDB running locally on your machine, 
	then simply clean install maven. Deploy on your JEE6 web container of choice, 
	since it requires CDI enabled web server.
