==========

  As the name stands for, the focus here is a simple application capable of managing posts and replys with a single page aproach.

  Moreover, it is a proof of concepts. Basicaly a domain driven design java application, persisting with mongoDB and Jongo (jongo.org). Also defining a RESTfull service with the JBOSS RESTEasy and just for the fun of it, experimenting with JEE6 CDI and Google Angular. 
  
  To run it you will need an instance of mongoDB running localy on your machine, then simply clean install maven. Deploy on your JEE6 web container of choice, since it requires CDI anabled web server.
